### Feature Request: Add Support for Custom RSS Feed URLs

**Description:**
I would like to request a feature that allows users to add and manage custom RSS feed URLs within the NerdFeed Kodi add-on. This would enable users to integrate their preferred content sources directly into the add-on, enhancing flexibility and personalization.

**Use Case:**
Many users have specific RSS feeds they follow that may not be included in the default list provided by NerdFeed. By allowing users to add their own RSS feed URLs, they can tailor their content experience to better suit their interests. This feature would be particularly beneficial for users who follow niche topics or specific content creators.

**Proposed Implementation:**
1. **User Interface:** 
   - Add an option in the settings menu to "Add Custom RSS Feed."
   - Provide a text input field for users to enter the RSS feed URL.
   - Include a "Save" button to store the custom feed.

2. **Feed Management:**
   - Allow users to view a list of their added custom feeds.
   - Provide options to edit or delete existing custom feeds.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement validation to ensure that the entered URL is a valid RSS feed.
   - Display appropriate error messages if the feed cannot be fetched.

**Additional Information:**
This feature could significantly enhance user engagement and satisfaction by allowing for a more personalized content experience. It would also encourage users to explore and utilize the NerdFeed add-on more extensively.
